        <Text>
          Smoothie Factory<sup>®</sup> gift cards are not subject to any service fees or expiration dates. Your use of a
          gift card constitutes your acceptance of the complete Gift Card Rules (including the Arbitration provisions).
          Gift cards are redeemable for food, drink and eligible merchandise at participating locations in the United
          States. Eligible merchandise or services are determined by Smoothie Factory<sup>®</sup> in its sole discretion
          and may be changed without notice. Gift cards cannot be used to purchase other gift cards and you will not
          receive Rewards points for the purchase of any gift card. Gift cards cannot be redeemed for cash or applied as
          payment to any account, unless required by law. In California, all gift cards are redeemable for cash upon
          request if the balance on the card is less than $10.00. Gift cards may be redeemable for cash when their
          balance falls below a certain amount in other states within the United States as well.
        </Text>

        <Title>ELECTRONIC GIFT CARDS</Title>
        <Text>
          The Electronic Gift Card program allows you to purchase and send a virtual Card via email. You may choose the
          design and dollar value (within certain limits) and complete your purchase using a credit card, or debit card.
          You will need the email address for the recipient of your Card eGift (also known as an “eGift” or “eGift
          Card”). You authorize us to charge your credit card or debit card at the time you purchase your eGift.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          We will send the recipient of your eGift an email notifying them that they have received an eGift from you. He
          or she will then be able to print out the eGift and bring it into a location to make a purchase. An eGift is
          like a gift card and should be treated like cash by the recipient.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Each eGift has a unique gift card account number associated with it no matter how many times the email is
          printed out. We will only give refunds for unused eGifts with the original receipt.
        </Text>
        <Title>ADDING VALUE TO YOUR GIFT CARD</Title>
        <Text>
          In the United States, you can load a dollar value on a gift card by using a credit card, debit card or cash by
          visiting any participating location. You may not load more than $500 worth of value on each gift card. The
          minimum amount that must be loaded onto your gift card is $5. Smoothie Factory<sup>®</sup> may change the
          maximum and minimum amounts at any time by notifying you at the point of sale, by phone when you call or on
          the Sites, and such change shall not constitute an amendment to these Gift Card Rules.

        <Title>LOST, STOLEN OR DAMAGED GIFT CARD REPLACEMENT POLICY</Title>
        <Text>
          Unless you have an original sales receipt for your gift card and your 16-digit gift card number, or unless it
          has been registered by you on <Link href="/about-us">smoothiefactory.com</Link> and you can provide us your
          email address or phone number that you used to register your gift card, the remaining gift card value will not
          be replaced if lost, stolen or damaged.
        </Text>
        <ul>
          <ListItem>
            If you registered your gift card with us, you can contact us via the Contact Us section of the Site or via
            your account balance page (go to disable my gift card) and we can deactivate your lost, stolen or damaged
            gift card and load the balance remaining at the time of notification onto a new gift card or FACTORY REWARDS
            <sup>®</sup>
            account.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            You can also go into a participating location, with your original receipt for the gift card purchase and
            your 16-digit gift card number or, again, if you registered the gift card with us and you can provide your
            email address or phone number that you used to register the gift card. The restaurant personnel can
            deactivate your gift card and issue you a new gift card with the remaining balance.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            If you cannot either go online or to a participating Smoothie Factory<sup>®</sup> restaurant and if your
            gift card has been lost, stolen or damaged, please mail: (1) the 16-digit gift card number (or if you
            registered your gift card with us, you can provide us with the email address or phone number used at the
            time of registration), (2) an original location receipt indicating the purchase of the gift card, (3) a copy
            of a valid government issued I.D. (Driver’s License, Military I.D., or Passport), and (4) your complete name
            and mailing address to: Smoothie Holdings, LLC, Attn: Gift Cards Replacement, 14860 Montfort Drive, Suite
            150 PMB 34, Dallas, TX 75254. Upon satisfactory receipt of these required information, Smoothie Factory
            <sup>®</sup> will cancel your old gift card and issue a new gift card in the amount of any remaining balance
            on your old gift card on the date of Smoothie Factory<sup>®</sup>’s receipt of the such information. The
            replacement gift card will be mailed to the address you provide, which must be a valid street address. P.O.
            Boxes will not be accepted. Please make a copy of all documents you submit to us for your records. All
            documents submitted become Smoothie Factory<sup>®</sup>’s property and will not be returned. Please allow up
            to 8 weeks for delivery of the replacement gift card. Smoothie Factory shall not be responsible for any
            lost, late, illegible, damaged, misdirected, incomplete or postage due mail. Reproduction, purchase, trade
            or sales of Report Form, gift card numbers, and or cash register receipts are prohibited. Fraudulent
            submissions may result in prosecution under applicable federal mail fraud statutes.
          </ListItem>
        </ul>
        <Title>FRAUD ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR GIFT CARD OR CARD BALANCE</Title>
        <Text>
          We will not accept any gift card, or will limit use of any gift card or gift card balance, if we reasonably
          believe that the use is unauthorized, fraudulent or otherwise unlawful, and we consider such action
          appropriate to limit our risk. Smoothie Factory<sup>®</sup> does not control who may sell preloaded gift
          cards, nor can we control the price or preloaded denominations offered by independent sellers. Consequently,
          Smoothie Factory<sup>®</sup>
          has no liability to you for any third party fraud or unlawful activity associated with any gift card balance.
          If Smoothie Factory<sup>®</sup> discovers any gift card or gift card balance was sourced or derived from fraud
          or other unlawful means, in our sole discretion, we may cancel all impacted gift cards and retain all related
          gift card balances without notice to you. We may use retained gift card balances to help offset our liability
          to card companies, networks and issuers of lost or stolen credit and debit cards used to purchase or load gift
          cards.
        </Text>
        <Title>REGISTRATION, LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS</Title>
        <Text>
          To register your gift card, please visit <Link href="/">smoothiefactory.com</Link>. When registering a gift
          card, you agree that you will: (i) provide complete and accurate information about yourself; and (ii) update
          such information if it changes. If you do not provide or update such information, or if we have reasonable
          grounds to suspect that you have not provided or updated such information, we shall have the right, in our
          sole and absolute discretion, to disable your gift card. If you believe your gift card has been disabled in
          error, please call (214) 302-5979. You are responsible for: (a) the accuracy of all information that you
          provide to us; and (b) maintaining the confidentiality and security of your gift card information.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Because your gift card is used like cash for purchases from participating locations, you are responsible for
          all transactions associated with your gift card, including unauthorized transactions. However, if your gift
          card is lost, stolen or destroyed, the card can be replaced with the balance remaining on it at the time of
          your call, but only if you have registered it with us. Please notify us immediately if you change any of your
          registration information. If your gift card becomes lost, stolen or damaged, you should contact us via the
          Contact Us section of the Site. Your gift card balance is only protected from the point in time you notify us
          that your gift card is missing. We will freeze the remaining balance on your gift card at the time you notify
          us and will load that remaining balance on a replacement gift card.
        </Text>
        <Title>ARBITRATION</Title>
        <Text>
          Please read this section carefully. It affects rights that you may otherwise have. It provides for resolution
          of most disputes through arbitration instead of court trials and class actions. Arbitration is more informal
          than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and discovery is more limited.
          Arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a court. This arbitration clause
          shall survive termination of these Gift Card Rules.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          This provision is intended to be interpreted broadly to encompass all disputes or claims arising out of or
          relating to these Gift Card Rules, your gift card and your relationship with us. Any dispute or claim arising
          out of or relating to these Gift Card Rules or use of the gift card and your relationship with Smoothie
          Factory or any subsidiary, parent or affiliate company or companies (whether based in contract, tort, statute,
          fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory) will be resolved by binding arbitration, except that
          either of us may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for hearing by such a court.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Notwithstanding the above, you may choose to pursue your claim in court and not by arbitration if you opt out
          of this arbitration provision within 30 days from the earliest of the date you purchased, loaded, reloaded or
          used any of your gift cards (the “Opt Out Deadline”) after these Gift Card Rules have gone into effect. You
          may opt out of these arbitration procedures by sending us a written notice that you opt out to the following
          address: Smoothie Holdings, LLC, Attn: Customer Service, 14860 Montfort Drive, Suite 150 PMB 34, Dallas, TX
          75254. Any opt-out received after the Opt Out Deadline (allowing three (3) additional days for mailing) will
          not be valid and you must pursue your claim in arbitration or small claims court.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          For all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first send a written description of your
          For all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first send a written description of your
          claim to our Customer Service department to allow us an opportunity to resolve the dispute. You and we each
          agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. You may request arbitration if your claim or dispute cannot be
          resolved within sixty (60) days. The arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be conducted in accordance with
          the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (as
          applicable), as modified by this Agreement. The AAA Rules and information about arbitration and fees are
          available online at www.adr.org. You and we agree that these Gift Card Rules evidences a transaction in
          interstate commerce and this arbitration provision will be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the
          U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, and not governed by state law. Any arbitration will
          be held in a reasonably convenient location in the state in which you reside or at another mutually agreed
          location. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language. An arbitrator may award on an individual
          basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief to the extent
          required to satisfy your individual claim, and must follow and enforce these Gift Card Rules and this
          arbitration agreement as a court would. Any arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may
          disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for
          purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any
          court having proper jurisdiction.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Except for claims determined to be frivolous, upon filing of the arbitration demand, we will pay half of all
          filing, administration and arbitrator fees other than the initial $200 filing fee. Each party will bear the
          fees and expense of its own attorneys, experts, witnesses and preparation and presentation of evidence at the
          arbitration.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          You and we each agree that any proceeding, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an
          individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If a court or arbitrator
          determines in an action between you and us that this class action waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration
          agreement will be void as to you. If you opt out of the arbitration provision as specified above, this class
          action waiver provision will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other customer, can be a class
          representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated or representative proceeding
          without having complied with the opt out procedure set forth above. If for any reason a claim proceeds in
          court rather than through arbitration, you and we each waive any right to a jury trial.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          These Gift Card Rules and this agreement to arbitrate shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
          the laws of the State of Texas not withstanding any conflict-of-laws rules.

          Factory
          <sup>®</sup> Gift Card program (i.e., Gift Card Rules), these Terms constitute a binding agreement between you
          and Smoothie Factory<sup>®</sup> and supersede all prior agreements, understandings and representations
          between the parties regarding the subject matter herein. In the event of an inconsistency between these Terms
          and either the Smoothie Factory<sup>®</sup> Loyalty Program Rules or the Gift Card Rules relating to your use
          of the Sites, these Terms shall prevail. In the event of an inconsistency between these Terms and the Smoothie

          <sup>®</sup> Loyalty Program Rules shall prevail. In the event of an inconsistency between these Terms and the
          Gift Card Rules relating to your use of your Smoothie Factory<sup>®</sup> gift card, the Gift Card Rules shall
          prevail. No failure by Smoothie Factory<sup>®</sup> or you to exercise any rights, powers or remedies
          hereunder or its delay to do so shall constitute a waiver of these rights, powers or remedies. The single or
          partial exercise of a right, power or remedy shall not prevent its subsequent exercise or the exercise of any
          other right, power or remedy. If any provision of these Terms or part thereof is or becomes illegal, invalid
          or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of that provision will
          not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the remainder of the provision or the remaining
          provisions of these Terms, as the case may be, or the legality, validity or enforceability of that provision
          or part thereof in any other jurisdiction. These Terms are effective until terminated by you or Smoothie
