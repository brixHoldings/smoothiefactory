        <Title>COMPLIANCE STATUS</Title>
        <Text>
          We firmly believe that the internet should be available and accessible to anyone and are committed to
          providing a website that is accessible to the broadest possible audience, regardless of ability. To fulfill
          this, we aim to adhere as strictly as possible to the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content
          Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines explain how to make web content
          accessible to people with a wide array of disabilities. Complying with those guidelines helps us ensure that
          the website is accessible to all people: blind people, people with motor impairments, visual impairment,
          cognitive disabilities, and more. This website utilizes various technologies that are meant to make it as
          accessible as possible at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows persons with specific
          disabilities to adjust the website's UI (user interface) and design it to their personal needs. Additionally,
          the website utilizes an AI-based application that runs in the background and optimizes its accessibility level
          constantly. This application remediates the website's HTML, adapts its functionality and behavior for
          screen-readers used by blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments.

        <Title>GIFT CARDS TERMS AND CONDITIONS ("Gift Card Rules")</Title>
        <Text>
          The Gift Card Terms and Conditions (this "Gift Card Rules") is an agreement between you and SF+K and describes
          the terms and conditions that apply to your gift card. By buying, loading, or using a Gift Card, you agree to
          these terms. Please read the following provisions, as well as the complete Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
          that govern the Sites. These Gift Card Rules include an Arbitration provision that governs any disputes
          between you and us. This provision will: 1) Eliminate your right to a trial by jury; and 2) Substantially
          affect your rights, including preventing you from bringing, joining, or participating in class or consolidated
          proceedings.
        </Text>

        <Title>ABOUT YOUR GIFT CARD</Title>
        <Text>
          SF+K gift cards are not subject to any service fees or expiration dates. Your use of a gift card constitutes
          your acceptance of the complete Gift Card Rules (including the Arbitration provisions). Gift cards are
          redeemable for food, drink and eligible merchandise at participating SF+K locations in the United States.
          Eligible merchandise or services are determined by SF+K in its sole discretion. You will not receive loyalty
          points for the purchase of any gift card. Gift cards cannot be redeemed for cash or applied as payment to any
          account, unless required by law. For instance, in California, all gift cards are redeemable for cash upon
          request if the balance on the card is less than $10.00. Gift cards may be redeemable for cash when their
          balance falls below a certain amount in other states within the United States as well.
        </Text>

        <Title>ELECTRONIC GIFT CARDS</Title>
        <Text>
          The Electronic Gift Card program allows you to purchase and send a virtual gift card via email. You may choose
          the design and dollar value (within certain limits) and complete your purchase using a credit card, or debit
          card. You will need the email address for the recipient of your eGift card (also known as an "eGift" or "eGift
          Card"). You authorize us to charge your credit card or debit card at the time you purchase your eGift.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          We will send the recipient of your eGift an email notifying them that they have received an eGift from you.
          They will then be able to print out the eGift and bring it into a location to make a purchase. An eGift is
          like a gift card and should be treated like cash by the recipient.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Each eGift has a unique gift card account number associated with it no matter how many times the email is
          printed out. We will only give refunds for unused eGifts with the original receipt.
        </Text>

        <Title>ADDING VALUE TO YOUR GIFT CARD</Title>
        <Text>
          When this function is made available, you will be able to load a dollar value on a physical gift card in the
          United States by using a credit card, debit card or cash by visiting any participating SF+K location. You may
          not load more than $500 worth of value on each gift card. The minimum amount that must be loaded onto your
          gift card is $5. SF+K may change the maximum and minimum amounts at any time by notifying you at the point of
          sale, by phone when you call or on the Sites, and such change shall not constitute an amendment to these Gift
          Card Rules.
        </Text>

        <Title>LOST, STOLEN OR DAMAGED GIFT CARD REPLACEMENT POLICY</Title>
        <Text>
          Unless you have an original sales receipt for your gift card and your 16 or 19-digit gift card number, the
          remaining gift card value will not be replaced if lost, stolen or damaged. If you have your original sales
          receipt for your gift card and your 16 or 19-digit gift card number, then you can send an email to{' '}
          <a href="mailto:info@smoothiefactorykitchen.com">info@smoothiefactorykitchen.com</a> and include the following
          information: (1) the 16 or 19-digit gift card number, (2) a photo copy of the original location receipt
          indicating the purchase of the gift card, (3) a copy of a valid government issued I.D. (Driver's License,
          Military I.D., State Issued I.D. or Passport); and (4) your name, email, phone number and mailing address.
          Upon satisfactory receipt of this required information, SF+K will cancel your old gift card and issue a new
          eGift Card in the amount of any remaining balance on your old gift card on the date of SF+K receipt of such
          information; the eGift Card will be emailed to the email address you provide. Reproduction, purchase, trade or
          sales of Report Form, gift card numbers, and or cash register receipts are prohibited. Fraudulent submissions
          may result in prosecution under applicable federal mail fraud statutes.
        </Text>

        <Title>FRAUD ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR GIFT CARD OR CARD BALANCE</Title>
        <Text>
          We will not accept any gift card or will limit use of any gift card or gift card balance, if we reasonably
          believe that the use is unauthorized, fraudulent or otherwise unlawful, and we consider such action
          appropriate to limit our risk. SF+K does not control who may sell preloaded gift cards, nor can we control the
          price or preloaded denominations offered by independent sellers. Consequently, SF+K has no liability to you
          for any third-party fraud or unlawful activity associated with any gift card balance. If SF+K discovers any
          gift card or gift card balance was sourced or derived from fraud or other unlawful means, in our sole
          discretion, we may cancel all impacted gift cards and retain all related gift card balances without notice to
          you. We may use retained gift card balances to help offset our liability to card companies, networks and
          issuers of lost or stolen credit and debit cards used to purchase or load gift cards.
        </Text>

        <Title>LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS</Title>
        <Text>
          You are responsible for: (a) the accuracy of all information that you provide to us; and (b) maintaining the
          confidentiality and security of your gift card information. Because your gift card is used like cash for
          purchases from participating restaurant locations, you are responsible for all transactions associated with
          your gift card, including unauthorized transactions. However, if your gift card is lost, stolen or destroyed,
          the card can be replaced with the balance remaining on it at the time of your call, but only if you have the
          16-digit number and the original purchase receipt for the gift card. If your gift card becomes lost, stolen or
          damaged, you should contact us via the Contact Us section of the Site. Your gift card balance is only
          protected from the point in time you notify us that your gift card is missing. We will freeze the remaining
          balance on your gift card at the time you notify us and will load that remaining balance on a replacement gift
          card which will be an eGift Card.
        </Text>

        <Title>ARBITRATION</Title>
        <Text>
          Please read this section carefully. It affects rights that you may otherwise have. It provides for resolution
          of most disputes through arbitration instead of court trials and class actions. Arbitration is more informal
          than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and discovery is more limited.
          Arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a court. This arbitration clause
          shall survive termination of these Gift Card Rules.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          This provision is intended to be interpreted broadly to encompass all disputes or claims arising out of or
          relating to these Gift Card Rules, your gift card and your relationship with us. Any dispute or claim arising
          out of or relating to these Gift Card Rules or use of the gift card and your relationship with SF+K or any
          subsidiary, parent or affiliate company or companies (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
          misrepresentation or any other legal theory) will be resolved by binding arbitration, except that either of us
          may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for hearing by such a court.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Notwithstanding the above, you may choose to pursue your claim in court and not by arbitration if you opt out
          of this arbitration provision within 30 days from the earliest of the date you purchased, loaded, reloaded or
          used any of your gift cards (the "Opt Out Deadline") after these Gift Card Rules have gone into effect. You
          may opt out of these arbitration procedures by sending us a written notice that you opt out to the following
          address: Smoothie Factory + Kitchen, Attn: Customer Service, 14860 Montfort Drive, Suite 150 PMB34, Dallas, TX
          75254. Any opt-out received after the Opt Out Deadline (allowing three (3) additional days for mailing) will
          not be valid and you must pursue your claim in arbitration or small claims court.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          For all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first send a written description of your
          claim to our Customer Service department to allow us an opportunity to resolve the dispute. You and we each
          agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. You may request arbitration if your claim or dispute cannot be
          resolved within sixty (60) days. The arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be conducted in accordance with
          the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as
          applicable), as modified by this Agreement. The AAA Rules and information about arbitration and fees are
          available online at www.adr.org. You and we agree that these Gift Card Rules evidences a transaction in
          interstate commerce and this arbitration provision will be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the
          U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law and not governed by state law. Any arbitration will
          be held in a reasonably convenient location in the state in which you reside or at another mutually agreed
          location. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language. An arbitrator may award on an individual
          basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief to the extent
          required to satisfy your individual claim, and must follow and enforce these Gift Card Rules and this
          arbitration agreement as a court would. Any arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may
          disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for
          purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any
          court having proper jurisdiction.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Except for claims determined to be frivolous, upon filing of the arbitration demand, we will pay half of all
          filing, administration and arbitrator fees other than the initial $200 filing fee. Each party will bear the
          fees and expense of its own attorneys, experts, witnesses and preparation and presentation of evidence at the
          arbitration.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          You and we each agree that any proceeding, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an
          individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If a court or arbitrator
          determines in an action between you and us that this class action waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration
          agreement will be void as to you. If you opt out of the arbitration provision as specified above, this class
          action waiver provision will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other customer, can be a class
          representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated or representative proceeding
          without having complied with the opt out procedure set forth above. If for any reason a claim proceeds in
          court rather than through arbitration, you and we each waive any right to a jury trial.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          These Gift Card Rules and this agreement to arbitrate shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
          the laws of the State of Texas not withstanding any conflict-of-laws rules.

          enforceability of that provision or part thereof in any other jurisdiction. These Terms are effective until
